				"1.  Read the pattern thoroughly before beginning. I like to quickly look over the entire pattern before beginning a project and look to see which 	techniques will be used.  At the same time I can also look for ways to save time: I like to chain piece as much as possible, and by looking over the pattern at the beginning I can figure out ways to combine steps and save time.",

				"2.  Make a quick list of individual units needed to complete the quilt. The quilt I just finished had 216 scrappy flying geese units, 288 half-square triangles, 144 squares with two easy corner triangles on each, and 24 square in a square blocks.  I made a checklist with each of these units and the other major steps needed to get all of the parts and pieces ready for this quilt. Four of the above steps had to be completed before I could put the blocks together.  It made a lot of sense for me to break it down into steps rather than just write “make blocks” on my list.  Plus, I felt good being able to cross the individual items off of my list."

				"Straight line quilting is the easiest way to finish a quilt and it’s especially great for beginner quilters. After spending so much time making a quilt, you can confidently quilt it yourself in straight or wavy lines. Here are 4 easy variations on straight line quilting that I think YOU will love. When you take straight line quilting to the extreme, you get matchstick quilting.",

				"This is basic straight line quilting with the lines about 1/2'' apart - I use the edge of my walking foot as a guide. I tend to 'eyeball' the lines (for every method) and don't stress a lot if they vary a little. I think that some natural variation gives my quilts an organic feel - there's no doubt that they are handmade, not mass produced. I love that! If you want to mark your quilts that’s fine too."

         		"When you’re not a quilter, rulers are just this thing that takes up space in the back of your widest desk drawer. Behind all the random pens and batteries, you probably have one floating around that you use sometimes to reach things that get stuck underneath the refrigerator. Amiright?",

				"And then, you become a quilter, and your life changes. And so does your relationship with rulers. Rulers are no longer just tools, but treasures. I know you know what I’m talking about.",

				"After becoming a quilter, I quickly moved past that phase of quilting life where I was like “I don’t need any specialty tools!” and discovered that having a collection of quilting rulers is really, really amazing. I love my rulers. Sometimes, I’m tempted to name them and write them each birthday cards.",

				"Here are some of the Best Quilting Rulers that will help you Rule the Quilting World!​ Clever, eh?"

            	"When it comes to quilting sewing machines, you’ll find a different style for each sewing need. From simple mending to making dresses, from embroidery to quilting – there’s a quilting machine for it!",

				"When it comes to sewing machines for quilting, how do you decide which one is right for you?",

				"First, decide what your quilting plans and projects will be. Are you only going to be piecing quilts, or do you want to do the top quilting as well? If you’ll be doing free motion stitching, you’ll want something with a larger table area (also called the throat). Then, decide what you are willing to spend. If you feel you need a top-of-the-line, computerized machine that does everything but the dishes, you can expect to spend thousands of dollars. (The Janome Horizon Quilt Maker Memory Craft 12000 can set you back over $5,000.)"
